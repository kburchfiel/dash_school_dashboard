This project, which is still in its early stages, shows how to build a simple interactive school dashboard using Plotly and Dash.

In order to view the output of the project, visit https://dsd-vtwzngx2pa-uc.a.run.app/ . The project is hosted on Google Cloud Run 
and will take several seconds to load up initially.
